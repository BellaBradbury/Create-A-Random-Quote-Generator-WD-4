# A RANDOM QUOTE GENERATOR


---APP OVERVIEW---

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This page displays a new random quote & background color upon each content refresh. The refresh could occur via user interaction or in automatic 30 second intervals. Extra care has been taken to ensure that the quote is always readable due to unpredictable background color values.
